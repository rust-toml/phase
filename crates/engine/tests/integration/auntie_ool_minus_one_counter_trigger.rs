//! Regression for issue #1510 — Auntie Ool, Cursewretch's "-1/-1 counters put
//! on a creature" trigger, and the CR 704.5q +1/+1 / -1/-1 annihilation that
//! surrounds it.
//!
//! Oracle (relevant line):
//!   "Whenever one or more -1/-1 counters are put on a creature, draw a card if
//!    you control that creature. If you don't control it, its controller loses
//!    1 life."
//!
//! Bug as reported: putting -1/-1 counters on a creature that already has +1/+1
//! counters "removes the -1/-1 counters". The removal is correct per CR 704.5q
//! (pairs of +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters cancel). The genuine defect surfaced while
//! reproducing it: the trigger resolved BOTH branches unconditionally — the
//! controller always drew a card AND "that creature's controller" always lost 1
//! life — instead of choosing exactly one branch on whether the controller
//! controls the creature the counters were put on.
//!
//! These tests drive the real cast → counter-placement → SBA → trigger pipeline
//! from parsed Oracle text (no hand-built AST), so they fail on the pre-fix
//! engine and pass once the control branch is gated correctly.
